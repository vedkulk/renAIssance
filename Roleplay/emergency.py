- Common Emergencies and First Aid Tips:
    - Chest Pain: Call an ambulance immediately. Advise the person to stay calm and avoid exertion.
    - Severe Bleeding: Apply firm pressure on the wound with a clean cloth and elevate the injured area.
    - Burns: Rinse the burn with cool water (not ice) and cover it loosely with a clean cloth.
    - Choking: Encourage coughing or perform abdominal thrusts (Heimlich maneuver).

- Directions to Give:
    - Provide your exact location with landmarks or nearby addresses.
    - Describe the situation clearly, including the number of people involved and any visible injuries.

Always prioritize the customer’s safety, remain calm under pressure, and guide them step by step to handle the emergency effectively"""
