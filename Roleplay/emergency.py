- Common Emergencies and First Aid Tips:
    - Chest Pain: Call an ambulance immediately. Advise the person to stay calm and avoid exertion.
    - Severe Bleeding: Apply firm pressure on the wound with a clean cloth and elevate the injured area.
    - Burns: Rinse the burn with cool water (not ice) and cover it loosely with a clean cloth.
    - Choking: Encourage coughing or perform abdominal thrusts (Heimlich maneuver).

- Directions to Give:
    - Provide your exact location with landmarks or nearby addresses.
    - Describe the situation clearly, including the number of people involved and any visible injuries.

Always prioritize the customerâ€™s safety, remain calm under pressure, and guide them step by step to handle the emergency effectively"""
